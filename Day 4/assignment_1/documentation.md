the previous day we leraned how to generate random patterns and for this assignment we had to generate a continuous pattern using images. At first I tried to make it using primary shapes like circle, triangle and square but it started to look like a tile pattern rather than a continuous pattern. While drawing patterns on paper I learned that the points on the opposite side of the square should be the same for all the blocks of pattern created, then only when i=the images come together it will look like a continuous pattern.
