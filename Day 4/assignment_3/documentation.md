On the same day we also learned about how to use arrow keys for the character and make it move on the canvas. We also learned how to make 2D spritesheet. For the assignment I downloaded a spritesheet of a duck walking. The spritesheet was not proper so I first edited it on illustrator and then exported it as png. It was a very fun exercise and I was happy to see the ducky walking.
