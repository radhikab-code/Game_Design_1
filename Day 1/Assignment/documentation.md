This was the very first day of learning p5js, it was very fascinating to see how few codes can generate abstract art and shapes. The very first assignment was to represent any emotion in a composition of shapes, like an abstract art. I choose to create art for the emotion fear. I tried to represent the idea of 'fear of judgement' through ellipses of varied shapes. I tried using rotate function in this but couldn't apply to all the ellipses. It was a fun exercise.
