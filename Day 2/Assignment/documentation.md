On day 2 we learned about mousex and mousey function. We started from basics and tried to create a paintbrush for the canvas using it. For the assignment we had to convert the previous emotion we selected into a different emotion. I got fear to anger. It was intresesting and fun to add anger to the abstract composition as the one I made was representing eyes by using ellipse as shapes. In anger our pupils dilate and vibrate and I tried to represent the same in the composition. I applied map and sin function for the opacity change in the red ellipse and random range function for the vibration of pupils.
