Absolutism:


Absolutism is a form of government where one ruler holds all the power — usually a king or queen — and their authority is not limited by laws, constitutions, or other political institutions. 
The monarch’s word = law
Absolutism became popular in Europe during the 16th–18th centuries, after long periods of war and chaos (like religious conflicts). People wanted strong leadership and stability, so powerful monarchs gained more control.
The main belief behind absolutism is the “divine right of kings.”
In history, this idea was shown through kings and queens who ruled without limits — like Louis XIV of France, who famously said “I am the state.”
This means the ruler’s authority comes directly from God, not from the people — so no one can question or challenge them.
The monarch controls the entire government, military, economy, and legal system.
There are no parliaments or courts that can limit the ruler’s decisions.
Absolute monarchs often built grand palaces (like Versailles) to display their wealth and power.
They often used religion and art to justify or glorify their rule.

By the late 18th century, absolutism started to weaken due to:
Enlightenment ideas promoting individual rights and democracy.
Revolutions (like the French Revolution) that challenged royal power.
Growing influence of parliaments and constitutions.



Concept :
At the top of the screen sits a King on a throne, watching over the match like a powerful ruler. His presence sets the tone for the game, symbolizing authority and control.

The game consists of six rounds. The left paddle, controlled by the computer (the Monarch), plays against the right paddle, controlled by the player. Each round is worth one point, and whenever the player misses the ball, the point automatically goes to the Monarch.

The core mechanic creates a feeling of inevitable defeat—the Monarch never loses. No matter how skilled the player becomes, victory always belongs to the Monarch. This unbalanced system represents the idea of absolutism, where ordinary people can never defy or overcome the supreme power of the ruler.

As the rounds continue, the Monarch’s image grows larger and more dominant, reinforcing the theme of control and superiority.
