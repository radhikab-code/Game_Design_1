Absolutism:


Absolutism is a form of government where one ruler holds all the power — usually a king or queen — and their authority is not limited by laws, constitutions, or other political institutions. 
The monarch’s word = law
Absolutism became popular in Europe during the 16th–18th centuries, after long periods of war and chaos (like religious conflicts). People wanted strong leadership and stability, so powerful monarchs gained more control.
The main belief behind absolutism is the “divine right of kings.”
This means the ruler’s authority comes directly from God, not from the people — so no one can question or challenge them.
The monarch controls the entire government, military, economy, and legal system.
There are no parliaments or courts that can limit the ruler’s decisions.
Absolute monarchs often built grand palaces (like Versailles) to display their wealth and power.
They often used religion and art to justify or glorify their rule.

By the late 18th century, absolutism started to weaken due to:
Enlightenment ideas promoting individual rights and democracy.
Revolutions (like the French Revolution) that challenged royal power.
Growing influence of parliaments and constitutions.



Concept :
The concept is such that there will be one refree like looking person standing at the top of the screen. the player might think its a refree but instead its the monarch but player will only know at the end. 
there will be 3 levels and each level the refree/monarch will get bigger in size. 
each level has 3 points to win, even if the player secures a score it will go to the other player making him/her frustrated. and by the end of each level the refree/monarch will say try hard. After finishing all the 3 levels the player will know that the monarch is the strongest and no one can defy the rule of the  monarch. the player paddles can be something from the same time period.
